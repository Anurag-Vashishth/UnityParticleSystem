## Rain

The effect of rain is achieved by constantly genrating a random number of particles at an appropriate height of the user with particles varrying in size but with an appropriate dimension ratio. The effect is further augmented by a adding a slight ripple effect on the ground. The material used in the proect are available with the Project.
